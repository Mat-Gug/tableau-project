# Tableau: Sales Analysis of a supermarket chain :shopping_cart: :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bar_chart:

Hello everyone, thank you for being here! ðŸ˜Š

This project is based on a dataset of a fictional company called Superstore, which is a forward-thinking company looking to maintain a strong presence in Europe. To achieve optimal results, it aims to make data-driven decisions and seeks a data expert to support the company with the best tools for this purpose. To optimize results, the business requires:
- A Tableau Dashboard for monitoring Superstore's activities in Europe.
- Insights to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

The first request is to build a Tableau Dashboard that can be used within the company to observe Superstore's activities. The business requests the ability to use this dashboard to monitor:
- Sales trends over time,
- Profitability across different countries in Europe,
- Quantity of products shipped per shipping class.

Naturally, the expectation is to use the dashboard dynamically, filtering through the visualizations.

In addition, Superstore wants to know how to allocate the marketing campaign budget effectively, so they request an analysis to decide where to invest. For this reason, the second request is to build a Tableau Story starting from a series of dashboards, visualizations, or a combination of both, allowing insights into:
- Which products to allocate more budget to,
- Which products to allocate less budget to,
- Which product(s) are recommended to be removed from the catalog.

Both parts of the project are available on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mattia.guglielmelli/vizzes), where they can also be downloaded. Enjoy! :grinning:
